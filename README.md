# couchcraft
Couchcraft is in active development!
This repo is mostly used for my issue tracker, so I don't lose track of my progress when I'm working on other projects. However, I do allow the commoner to commit to it, if you have any creative input, criticisms, or code please create a pull request, and do not commit to master.
:)

## What couchcraft can do ->
It can control your gameplay fine, with perks. Walking is analog, and can be as slow or as fast as you want it, depending on your gamepad stick. Empty hotbar slots are skipped, so picking items is as fast as your keyboard. The Gui cursor skips across gaps and only selects relevant information and clickable objects. And many more features to come!

## Is it playable, without a mouse and keyboard?
No. ( Not yet :O )
